Compare to multitasking

This parallelism tends to reduce overhead costs and differs from multitasking, which involves running several programs on the same OS.

Do we want to max out the CPU on your computer?

[ ] Yes

Objectives:

* Utilize more of hardware -- CPUs usually sitting idle 
* Centralize admin tasks
* Scalability
* Snapshots
* Teleportation
* Failover

The usual goal of virtualization is to centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and overall hardware-resource utilization.

With using Virtualization an enterprise will be able to better manage updates and rapid changes to the operating system and applications without disrupting the user. "Ultimately, virtualization dramatically improves the efficiency and availability of resources and applications in an organization. Instead of relying on the old model of “one server, one application” that leads to underutilized resource, virtual resources are dynamically applied to meet business needs without any excess fat" (ConsonusTech).

Hardware

Emulation -- one piece of hardware imitates another piece of hardware

Vocabulary:
    - Host (the software pretending to be hardware/the physical machine the hardware is in)
    - Guest (the software running inside that pretend  hardware (sometimes guest doesn't even know)
    - Hypervisor (or virtual machine manager)


   - Full virtualization - Software completely pretending to be hardware (the guest os doesn't know the difference)
   - Paravirtualization -- Hardware not simulated; The Guest OS however, is completely isolated into different domains like they're running on different hardware (Guest OS has to know it's being paravirtualized)
   - Partial virtualization -- half and half of the above. At least some guest OS needs to know it's paravirtualized


hardware assistance virtualization (special CPU -- intel has one; remember protected operations … CPU assembly protected.. not-protected.. why not a third one for virtualization)…

Software

Operating system-level virtualization

* VEs
* VPSs
* Jails

(chroot or FreeBSD Jail)

do chroot demo

Virtual Hosting
FTP SERVERS --

Little overhead  -- No emulation
Just clever and secure OS system call

VirtualEnv falls into here

Virtual Memory

1950s

See, we use the name without even stopping to think.

The concept of virtual memory was developed by the german physicist Fritz-Rudolf Güntsch at the Technische Universität Berlin in 1956.[4][5]
